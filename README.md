# r-piemap
An R implementation of quality pie.

## Status
Prototyping.

## Concepts
mapping value to an area.

Several scales are in use in the field.

Implementations provided:
* linear
* bi-monotone
* folded
* categorial

Constraints:
* up to 16 dimensions

Good to kneo:
* quality pies are best comparing with other such plots in a single view
* so, conventions on the placement of topical groups and dimensions derive from that comparison use

**Note**: The default branch is `default`.
